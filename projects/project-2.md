summary: Contract work to build flight searching admin interface.
---

SCF is a company that helps people find great deals on flights around the world. On a team of about 12 developers, I helped build features of the site that included the API endpoints for mobile integration, Admin Interface, I18n support for international language support, and more.

The project uses Ruby on Rails with React sprinkles on the front-end.

# Some cool tools I picked up
## Team Version Control
This job was where I built my foundational knowledge of using git in a team setting. Version control for development all the way through production including branches for staging and testing were extremely important on a moderately sized project like this.

## Test Driven Development
Building out a working test suite was a key part of working on a team and testing public methods. Worked on unit & integration tests in RSpec and the integration of the testing suite into continuous integration using CircleCI. Building out tests before writing code seemed like a hassle at the beginning, but proved a useful way of building out features methodically and sequentially while making sure they didnt break other features of the application.
