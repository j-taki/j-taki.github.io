summary: Contract work to build flight searching admin interface. 
---

SCF is a company that helps people find great deals on flights around the world. On a team of about 12 developers, I helped build features of the site that included the API endpoints for mobile integration, Admin Interface, I18n support for international language support, and more.

The project uses Ruby on Rails with React sprinkles on the front-end.
