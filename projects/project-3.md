ChefZone is a cash & carry food-distribution store in Hawaii that caters mainly to food operators and restauranteurs in Hawaii. The previous website design included a half-maintained blog with sloppy CSS classes and monkeypatched design. 

Building out some design standards in Sketch helped build reusable UI components and bring peace to a once chaotic site. Currently the site is completely on Wordpress, but the development branch of the site uses wordpress only as a headless CMS, then uses Gatsby as a Site Generator using graphQL to query for the WP content.
