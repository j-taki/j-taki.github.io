summary: My team developed an MVC framework & application
---

PHPinder allows classrooms to embrace teamwork by allowing students to rate other students after having done group assignments with them. PHPinder focuses on positive and constructive feedback rather than providing a place to slander other students. PHPinder allows teachers to better match students who have similar schedules and diversify group strengths.

The application features a fully functional and extensible MVC framework that we built from scratch in PHP. Features of the project are:
  - An authentication system implementing sessions and password encryption. 
  - Conditional rendering based on different levels of user permissions.
  - Rating System allows for aggregated review statistics on each user. 
  - User profile allows for changes in user image, bio, preferred work days. 

The two of us utilized [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) framework for styling, and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) for icons.
