# Hello World

I don't have a formal education in Computer Science. I picked up software development though ADD (Anger Driven Development) at work. Sometimes at an older company, you don't get the things you need to do better work, so I learned some basic scripting to automate a lot of processes at work with spreadsheets and data manipulation.  From there, I went more into web development and design. I've picked up a few contracts doing server-side development in the last 2 years.  

# Interests

My interests in software for the long term are at Systems Design and Project Management. My weakness is the technical aspects of Computer Science and I hope to use this time to strengthen those aspects of my skillset. I hope to improve my abilities in not only Javscript, but OOD design patterns and data modeling as well. 

I'm also interested in Networking & IOT. I haven't had much time to dedicate to it recently, but the last thing I reprovisioned my raspberry pi for was to build a pi-hole as a custom DNS server for my home network. This project was great to build a base understanding of networking and how all of the IOT devices in my house worked as I could see all of the requests that were being made. I think I'd like to build another skillset on networking and cloud infrastructure to be able to build scalable services on something like AWS.
